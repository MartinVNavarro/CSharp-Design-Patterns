## Abstract Factory ##
The Abstract Factory design pattern encapsulates general functionality of a family of similar classes into abstract classes and creational 'Factory' classes.

## Practical use: ##
This design creates a way for creating objects from a family of objects without having the explicitly specify the 'Product' class.
