## Observer Design Pattern ##
The Observer design pattern establishes a one to many relationship between a subject and observers.  When a change is made to the subject, observers will be notifies and can update accordingly.

## Practical use: ##
This pattern is especially useful for when observing objects are dependent on a single subject's state.  There is no need to tightly couple the subject and each observer by creating a special notification method on the subject.
