## Iterator Design Pattern ##
The iterator design pattern allows for iterative access through a data structure without needing direct access to the underlying structure.

## Practical use: ##
Iterators are commonly used in languages in order to iterate(as the name implies) through a data structure.  In many languages, Collections are used as the aggregate in this design pattern.  In languages such as Java and C#, libraries iterators are built into existing Collection classes.
