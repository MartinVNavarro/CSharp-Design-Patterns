## Command Design Pattern ##
The command design pattern is designed to encapsulate the functionality of executable commands in an object.

## Practical use: ##
The following can be achieved from this design:

- encapsulation of a request in an object
- parameterization of clients with different requests
- saving of requests in a queue

Additional functionality can be added on top of this design such as undo and redo capabilities and logging.
