## Mediator Design Pattern ##
The mediator design pattern allows for communication between objects in a system without coupling the two objects together.  Instead, the objects can send communication to each other through a mediator the handles all the communication.

## Practical use: ##
Removing the need to couple objects together in order to allow communication allows for scalable design.  As a system grows bigger, managing coupled objects becomes a heavy task.  By centralizing the communication handling onto a mediator, the handling is encapsulated onto a single location.
